# Multipage Dashboard App using Plotly Dash

This repository contains the source code files to make a multipage dashboard app as shown below. The app has been created using Plotly Dash framework and is written in Python. This boilerplate code is free to use and free to distribute. (Acknowledging this repository will always be appreciated but not necessary to do so. ;-))



## Running the App

Make sure you have installed Python 3.x and have pip available. You have to install the following python libraries.

```
dash==1.20.0
dash_bootstrap_components==0.10.7
```

A Requirements.txt file is added in this repository. You can install all the required libraries from the file using, 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then simply run the app using,

```bash
python app.py
```
